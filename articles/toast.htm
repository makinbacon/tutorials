<h3>Toast is a great snack! Here's how to make the perfect slice!</h3>
<br>
<h4><strong>Step 1: </strong>Toast your bread. Leave it so it is the slightest bit overdone.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 2: </strong>Once out of the toaster, put the butter on the toasted bread straight away. It will melt on the slightly overdone bread because it's hot.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3: </strong>Cut it (into 4 square quarters or 4 triangular quarters.)</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 4: </strong>Serve on a plate.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 5: </strong>Enjoy!</h4>
