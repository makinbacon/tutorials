<h3>Maybe it's your friends birthday, or maybe something else! Why not make them a card?</h3>
<br>
<h4><strong>Step 1: </strong>Get a piece of paper or card and fold it in half</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 2: </strong>On the front part write a message and a picture</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3: </strong>Make it colourful</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 4: </strong>Inside the card write who it's to and who it's from!</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 5: </strong>Post it or give it to your friend!</h4>
