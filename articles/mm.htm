<h3>Want to make some music? Here's how:</h3>
<br>
<h4><strong>Step 1: </strong>Go to https://soundation.com/studio</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 2: </strong>Now look to the right of the site when it loads up.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 3: </strong>The folder called Free Sounds is open</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 4: </strong>From there, press the Electronica folder to open it up and then the 125 folder. Now you have lots of sounds. Drag them into the little timeline.</h4>
<h4><strong>Step 5: </strong>To save your song press the "File" menu, then "Export .wav file"</h4>
